## AIM
In this notebook, we will see the actual difference between **gradient descent** and the **normal equation** in a practical approach. Most of the newbie Machine learning Enthusiasts learn about gradient descent during the linear regression and move further without even knowing about the most underestimated Normal Equation that is far less complex and provides very good results for small to medium size datasets.

## Prerequisites:
I assume that you are familiar with **python** and already have installed the **python 3** in your systems. I have used a **jupyter notebook** for this tutorial. You can use the IDE of your like. All required libraries come inbuilt in **anaconda** suite.
