# Logistic Regression from Scratch with Only Python Code
## Applying Logistic regression to a multi-feature dataset using only Python. Step-by-step implementation coding samples in Python

***Logistic Regression from ScratchIn this article, we will build a logistic regression model for classifying whether a patient has diabetes or not. The main focus here is that we will only use python to build functions for reading the file, normalizing data, optimizing parameters, and more. So you will be getting in-depth knowledge of how everything from reading the file to make predictions works.***
