**In this article, we will build a logistic regression model for classifying whether a patient has diabetes or not. The main focus here is that we 
will only use python to build functions for reading the file, normalizing data, optimizing parameters, and more. So you will be getting in-depth 
knowledge of how everything from reading the file to make predictions works.**

## Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is the entry-level supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification purposes. It is one of those algorithms that everyone should be aware of. Logistic Regression is somehow similar to linear regression but it has different cost function and prediction function(hypothesis).
Sigmoid and hypothesis function.
