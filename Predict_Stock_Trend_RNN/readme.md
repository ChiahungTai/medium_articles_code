# Predicting Stock Trend Using Deep Learning
In this project, we will build a deep learning model (specifically the RNN Model) that will help us to predict whether the given stock will go up or down in the future. Remember, we are not interested in predicting the actual values as that will be far more complex compared to the prediction of the trend.

## Prerequisites:-
On must have installed the **python 3** in his system. I have used a **jupyter notebook** for this project. You can use the IDE of your like.
## Installing Required Libraries
For this project, you need to have the following packages installed in your python. If they are not installed, you can simply use `pip install PackageName` .
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn
* Keras
* Tensorflow
