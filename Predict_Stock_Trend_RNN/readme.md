# Predicting Stock Trend Using Deep Learning
In this project, we will build a deep learning model (specifically the RNN Model) that will help us to predict whether the given stock will go up or down in the future. Remember, we are not interested in predicting the actual values as that will be far more complex compared to the prediction of the trend.
